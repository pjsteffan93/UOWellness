Emerit Faculty Participation in Faculty Governance An emerit faculty member will retain full governance rights - including voting rights- within her/his school or department whenever on the University payroll and serving actively in an instructional or research capacity. In addition, a school or department may, if it wishes, grant such rights to emerit faculty at other times. An emerit faculty member may introduce and address motions in the Faculty Senate and Faculty Assembly, as provided by the Constitution and bylaws adopted by those bodies. Use of University Facilities and Resources The University will provide, insofar as reasonably possible, working space and academic services to emerit faculty so they may continue their academic activities. Deans, department heads and directors will be responsible for assigning such space and services, considering, among other criteria, the likelihood an emerit faculty member will make sustained, productive use of them. An emerit faculty member also may apply for University financial support for research, travel to professional meetings, and the like. Again, Deans, department heads and directors will rule on such applications, considering always the typically high priority of regular, active-duty faculty members. Parking Any university faculty granted emerit status, who are not receiving compensation from the university have access to free day permits. Each day, you can log on to the parking portal and access a free day permit in any available commuter zone. If you have any questions regarding the parking permit for retired employees, please contact the Department of Public Safety’s Office of Parking and Transportation, https://parking.uoregon.edu/ ..
