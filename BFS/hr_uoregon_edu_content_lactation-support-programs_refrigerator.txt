Other Lactation Room Options If the designated campus lactation rooms do not meet your needs, please talk to your supervisor.  There may be an appropriate space within your unit or work area that could be made available for your use. If you or your supervisor have questions, contact Human Resources at hrinfo@uoregon.edu. Personal Refrigerator Loan Program The university has a limited supply of refrigerators available to loan nursing mothers - students, faculty and staff.  These apartment-sized personal refrigerators are for use in their campus offices and workspaces to store expressed milk. The loan period is generally 3 to 12 months and may be longer depending on the employee's needs. To find out more information or reserve a refrigerator, contact Human Resources at hrinfo@uoregon.edu . Breastfeeding Resources La Leche League of Oregon offers support, encouragement and information to mothers breastfeeding their babies. State law provides women protections related to breastfeeding. ORS 109.001 (2017) allows a woman to breastfeed in public. House Bill 2593 expands and amends ORS 653.077 , Oregon's current lactation in the workplace law. HB 2593 requires all employers, regardless of size, to provide nursing mothers with "a reasonable rest period to express milk each time the employee has a need to express milk." This language allows nursing mothers to take unpaid lactation breaks when needed. While these rest breaks are unpaid, there is an exception if a nonexempt employee takes their lactation break during a paid rest period. Guidance regarding unpaid rest periods for the expression of milk can be found on the Bureau of Labor and Industries website. If you have additional questions please contact Human Resources at hrinfo@uoregon.edu . Two helpful book recommendations for employees returning to work and breastfeeding are The Fifth Trimester by Lauren Smith Brody and Work. Pump. Repeat. by Jessica Shortall. The Mom's Room by Medela offers access to breastfeeding tips, education, resources and a community of other breastfeeding Moms. It's really important to identify your support network. Take a look at the 4th Trimester Project for ideas about what may be important to you during this time.
