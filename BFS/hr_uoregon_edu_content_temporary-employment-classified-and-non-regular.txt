All temporary appointments go through a formal review and approval process through Human Resources. A justification and description of job responsibilities must be included on the Request to Hire Temporary Employee online form. If you are unsure of the classification for the temporary position, contact talent@uoregon.edu for assistance in determining an appropriate classification. You may also submit the form without a classification and our team will review the request and reach out with a suggested classification. Temporary Classified and Temporary Non-Regular appointments are paid on an hourly basis. In rare instances, a lump sum payment may be approved (typically for a 1 day event or performance). Temporary Classified Temporary classified employees may be hired to fill emergency, non-recurring, short-term work, including leave replacement or other short-term assignments. The total hours for all such temporary work may not exceed 1040 hours in a twelve month period. Temporary classified employees are appointed into an SEIU classification and paid the hourly equivalent of the appropriate step within the pay range. Temporary Non-Regular If the work to be performed does not fit into an existing SEIU classification and is not Officer of Administration or Faculty work, the Non-Regular designation may be suggested for use by Talent Acquisition and an appropriate hourly rate established.  Temporary Non-Regular appointments are not subject to the 1040 hour limit. Temporary Non-Regular appointments are not suitable to appoint staff to perform OA level work.  Please see the OA Position and Pay Actions for information about Interim OA Appointments. In rare instances, and with the approval of the Director of Talent Acquisition or designee, the Temporary Non-Regular category may be used as a bridge to start an employee while an interim direct appointment to an OA position is being finalized. Selecting Candidates for Temporary Work Temporary appointments may be filled by direct appointment; a formal search is not required. Hiring units may consider former employees or former student workers for temporary employment. Retirees receiving PERS benefits may work for an employer participating in PERS, within certain limitations, and still maintain their retirement benefits. Retirees considering accepting temporary work should carefully review the “Work after Retirement” restrictions for retirees returning to work on the PERS website at: https://www.oregon.gov/pers/RET/Pages/index.aspx. The University also allows units or departments to obtain temporary help through employment agencies. For more information, visit Temporary Employment Agency Guidelines . Individuals hired via a temporary agency would not use the Request to Hire online process. Background Checks and Mandatory Training All employees must successfully pass job-related background checks; units are responsible for requesting background checks in accordance with the guidelines for hiring authorities . Background checks must be successfully completed prior the temporary employee’s start date. All employees are also required to complete mandatory Workplace Harassment Prevention training . For more information on conditions of appointment for temporary employees, please see the Temporary Employment Memo . Hiring Process Hiring unit completes the Request to Hire (RTH) Temporary Employee online form The form must include a clear justification stating why the position is needed, along with a description of duties and responsibilities. The form should be submitted in advance, once the hiring unit is aware of the need for the position, in order to expedite processing. It is not necessary to list an incumbent on the online form, if one has not yet been selected. If the incumbent is known, please list all details requested for the individual. The online form does not require unit approval or signatures. Units submitting the form are expected to have the approval of their appropriate unit leadership to initiate the temporary hire process. Approvals will be required on the PRF submission. HR reviews the form for compliance with employment rules, and notifies the submitter via email that the form has been approved or follows up with the unit to resolve questions. Upon approval, HR will provide the unit with the PRF, Temporary Employment Memo , and any required next steps. The unit identifies a candidate and makes a contingent offer of employment. Once the candidate has accepted the contingent offer, the hiring unit initiates the background check . HR will order the background check and provide confirmation to the unit when the background check has been successfully completed. The unit provides the Temporary Hire Payroll Packet and the Temporary Employment Memo to the employee. This may happen at the same time as the step above, but the start date will be contingent upon successful completion of the background check. The employee completes and returns the Temporary Employment Memo and Temporary Hire Payroll Packet to the hiring unit. The PRF and signed Temporary Employment Memo are submitted to Human Resources via the HR Document Submission Form . The memo can be included as an additional document with the PRF submission. Ensure you are using the link to submit a Temporary PRF. Upon receipt of the PRF, HR reviews the PRF, approves the hire, and forwards the PRF to Payroll for entry The unit verifies the I-9 and sends the Temporary Hire Payroll Packet directly to Payroll. Payroll enters the job in Banner, in the order received. To request an ID number (95#) be created immediately for your new temporary hire, email a copy of the EIF to payroll@uoregon.edu . Payroll will use the information from the EIF to enter the fields needed to create an ID number. The original EIF must still be submitted with the new hire packet for final processing, at which time Payroll will enter the job record in Banner.
