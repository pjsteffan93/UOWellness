Philosophy:
* PHIL 110: Human Nature
From a variety of viewpoints, this course takes up the question, 'what does it mean to be a human being, and who's asking, anyway' Perspectives considered may include genetics, psychoanalysis, Euro-American philosophy (including feminism as well as Latin American thought). Problem areas include the nature of sexuality, racial identity, embodiment, intersubjectivity, and projects of personal meaning. Typical assignments include exams and short papers. Class time involves interactive lecturing and dedicated discussion sections.
* PHIL 170: Love and Sex
Philosophers have deeply explored knowledge, existence, politics and ethics. Yet love and sex, which for most of us are central features of a good life, have received far less attention. When they have been addressed, particularly in the Western tradition, they have often been relegated to a place of lower status along with the body and passions in general. The result is that though love and sex may occupy a good deal of our time, attention, and emotional energy; though they cause us more acute joy and pain than most other human practices; we dont have ready access to a strong tradition of thinking about these aspects of human life. In this course, material from the philosophers who have thought about love and sex will be explored along with contemporary struggles around sexuality, sexual identity, sexual violence, love, romance, intimate relationships and marriage. Students will be challenged to develop their own philosophy of love and sex as a resource for exploring and surviving the challenges we all face in intimate and romantic relationships. This course will include the use of film and other visual images that some students may find offensive or troubling.
